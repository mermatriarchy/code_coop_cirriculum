## What is the internet, really?

The internet is basically one big file sharing network. That may be a bit of an oversimplification for what the internet is now, but that's how it started & its basic purpose still shows in the foundations of web development today.

The internet isn't one singular thing -- again, it's a network, so it's made up of a lot of moving parts including servers, routers & cables. It's a network that allows computers to "talk" to one another to share information.

## HTML

- HTML is one of the building blocks of the internet
- It gives a webpage structure
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- Markup languages are different than programming languages
- Markup languages give your page structure, programming languages will make your pages interactive & process data (animations, form submissions & the like)
- It's the standard markup language for documents that are displayed on a webpage
- HTML files are saved with the .html extension
